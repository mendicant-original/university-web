### Our Staff

Ruby Mendicant University was founded by Gregory Brown ([@seacreature](http://twitter.com/seacreature)), author of the book [Ruby Best Practices](http://rubybestpractices.com) and original author of the popular PDF generation library [Prawn](http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com).  Gregory hopes that RMU will serve as a good example of what can happen when the ideas behind the Free Software Movement are applied to education.

Jordan Byron ([@Jordan_Byron](http://twitter.com/jordan_byron)) serves as RMU's technical coordinator, and is the maintainer of our classroom administration software, [university-web](https://github.com/rmu/university-web).  In addition to working alongside Gregory doing consulting work through [Madriska](http://madriska.com), Jordan volunteers his time working on CT Mission of Mercy's [clinic management system](https://github.com/jordanbyron/mission_of_mercy).

Jia Wu is RMU's administrative coordinator, and assists with various miscellaneous tasks that would otherwise be neglected by Jordan and Gregory.  Jia is a post-doctoral psychology researcher at the Yale Child Study Center, where she works on developing software for experiments as well as statistical programming for brain wave analysis.  Jia is also Gregory's wife, and is responsible for tearing him away from the computer every once in a while.
