This Ruby on Rails application provides facilities to support a community of
teachers and learners. It currently offers the essentials needed to manage
multiple courses, and we are now also developing other features for enabling
members of the community to work together.

University Web is developed by the
[Ruby Mendicant University](http://university.rubymendicant.com) (RbMU), a
rapidly growing online learning community, and it is our core infrastructure.
We expect it to become potentially useful to other organizations, and hope that
it will be adopted elsewhere as it becomes mature.

Whether you are a member of RbMU or a developer interested in systems for
learning and education, we encourage you to check out the source code:
<http://github.com/rmu/university-web>

If you are not a member of RbMU, please get in touch through our public channels:

- **IRC:** #rmu

## Key Features

University Web is constantly evolving, but currently offers the following
functionality:

- Administration of course admissions
- Course management
- Assignment tracking
- A clean and user-friendly interface for students
- IRC channel integration
- In application document system

## Installation

University Web is a Ruby on Rails 3 application which runs on
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) databases. Other databases like MySQL
or SQLite are not officially supported.

**Always use the latest source code:** We are constantly working on this
application, with bug fixes and new features added daily, so please use the
very latest source code.

### Setting Up a Development Copy: Step by Step

To install a development version of University Web, follow these steps:

1. Fork our GitHub repository: <http://github.com/rmu/university-web>
2. Clone the fork to your computer
3. Run `bundle install` to install all of the dependencies

To configure University Web:

1. Create a `database.yml` file in `config`. The `config` directory contains
   an example `database.yml` for PostgreSQL.
2. Create a `config/initializers/secret_token.rb` file. The
   `config/initializers` directory contains an example `secret_token.rb` file
   with instructions for generating a secret token.
3. Create a `config/github.yml` files. The `config` directory contains an
   example `github.yml` file.
4. Run the Rails tasks to initialize a development and a test database:

    `rake db:migrate`
    `rake db:test:prepare`

5. Generate the static site by running `rake public-site:generate`

Finally, run the test suite to make sure everything is working correctly:

    rake test
